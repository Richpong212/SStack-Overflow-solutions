# Stack Overflow Solutions

This project contains solutions to various problems encountered on Stack Overflow, categorized by topics. Each solution is organized by its problem domain (e.g., general JavaScript problems, algorithms, data structures), and detailed explanations are provided for each solution.

## Problem Solutions

### General Solutions

- **[Unique Array of Objects](general_solutions/unique_object_array/README.md)**  
  Problem: Given two arrays of objects, find the unique objects from both arrays, considering objects with identical key-value pairs as duplicates.

### How to Run a Solution

1. **Navigate to the solution folder**:

   - For example, to test the unique array solution, go to the `general_solutions/unique_object_array/` folder.

2. **Run the solution**:

   - Each solution has a file called `index.js` (or `index.ts` for TypeScript projects). You can execute it using Node.js:
     ```bash
     node index.js
     ```

3. **Review the README**:
   - Inside each solution folder, there is a `README.md` file that explains the problem, the approach taken to solve it, and any other details. This file is useful for understanding the logic behind each solution.
