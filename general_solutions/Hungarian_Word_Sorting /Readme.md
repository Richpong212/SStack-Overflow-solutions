# Sorting Hungarian Words with Accents in JavaScript

To solve the problem of sorting Hungarian words (with accents) in JavaScript, you can leverage locales and collation that are built into JavaScript, which handles the specific language rules, including characters like `á`, `é`, `ö`, etc.

## Best and Simplest Approach:

The simplest and most efficient way to sort an array of words with Hungarian accents is to use the `localeCompare()` function, which is built into JavaScript and handles language-specific sorting rules.

Here’s how you can do it:

### Refer to the `index.js` file

```javascript
const words = ["áb", "ab", "abbb"];

const sortedWords = words.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b, "hu"));

console.log(sortedWords); // Output: ['ab', 'abbb', 'áb']
```
````

## Explanation:

- **`localeCompare()`**: This method compares two strings in the current locale (in this case, Hungarian `hu`). It takes into account the correct sorting of accented characters like `á` and `é`.

  - `'hu'` is the locale identifier for Hungarian, which tells `localeCompare()` to follow the sorting rules of the Hungarian language, including handling accents and other language-specific character orders.

- **`.sort()`**: This method sorts the array, and the comparator uses `localeCompare()` to compare the words properly according to Hungarian character ordering.

## Benefits:

- **Built-in Language Support**: `localeCompare()` automatically handles all language-specific rules for sorting, including handling accented characters.
- **Short and Clean**: This is by far the shortest, easiest, and most reliable method to handle such sorting tasks in JavaScript.

## Alternative Approach (Custom Comparator with Character Map):

If you want to implement a custom comparator, you can use a `Map` and `order` as shown in your original approach, but the `localeCompare()` method is generally preferred for these types of sorting tasks.

Here’s an example of a custom comparator using a `Map`:

```javascript
const hunCharsOrder = "aábcdeéfggyhiíjklmnoóöőpqrsttyuúüűvwxyz";
const order = new Map([...hunCharsOrder].map((c, i) => [c, i + 1]));

const comparator = (a, b) => {
  const minLength = a.length < b.length ? a.length : b.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < minLength; i++) {
    const diff = (order.get(a[i]) || 0) - (order.get(b[i]) || 0);
    if (diff !== 0) return diff;
  }
  return a.length - b.length;
};
```

While this approach works, it's more complex and requires maintaining a mapping of Hungarian characters. It's also less maintainable compared to using `localeCompare()`.

## Conclusion:

Using `localeCompare()` is the simplest and best solution for sorting Hungarian words with accents. It takes care of all the sorting rules automatically, is easy to implement, and is more maintainable.
